He knows the moment that he sees the balls levitating over Sophie's crib. His daughter, barely six months old, is giggling, her hands reaching up to touch the bright red, blue, and yellow balls. He takes one look around, one desperate glance for someone, anyone wearing strange, out-of-place, floor-length robes, anyone wielding a stick of wood, anyone who can give him an alternate explanation. His cousin Harry, maybe his cousin Harry has paid him an unexpected visit, or one of his cousin's friends. There's no reason, of course, for anyone from Harry's world to come into his, but he hopes for it anyway. He wouldn't even care that it's just past midnight, and that they would have broken into his house. He'd forgive them, for giving him an alternate explanation.
There is no one. He knew there would be no one before he looked.
Sophie gurgles and giggles again, one of the balls dipping. Reflexively, Dudley grabs it and keeps it from hitting her in the face.
They had baby-proofed the house. Before Sophie had come, he and Vicky had gone through the whole house, looking for anything that could possibly harm their precious rainbow child. Baby gates had gone up in front of all the stairs, for all that Sophie couldn't walk yet, and every electrical socket had been shut behind a hard plastic cover that the sales representative had sworn six ways from Sunday would be unbreakable by a child.
But if Sophie is magical, then all bets are off. Dudley doesn't know how to baby-proof a house if Sophie is magical
It takes a week of scrounging through the papers scattered in Vicky's craft room to find the envelope. Vicky doesn't throw anything out, especially not when it comes to Sophie, and thank God for that because Harry's card is stashed in a box holding a hundred other congratulatory cards. The envelope is a pale pink, the front with Harry's too-neat handwriting with the looped ys reading Dudley Dursley & Family. The card simply appeared one day, probably the work of an owl, but Dudley had told his wife that Harry had passed it off to him on his way to work.
It isn't that Dudley hasn't kept in contact with his cousin over the past twenty-odd years. Indeed, the fact that Dudley is the only one to keep in contact with Harry from the Dursley family says quite a lot. But he and Harry aren't close—they exchange cards at Christmas, they get together for an awkward coffee every once in a while, usually when Harry happens to be in Surrey and wants to catch up. They simply have nothing in common, nothing but old and often disturbing memories.
He has no one else to ask, and it's a second of work for him to yank the glitter-and-sequin-studded card from the envelope. The card is bright pink, thankfully normal, even if the glitter will never come out of the carpet on the floor. The front reads Congratulations! and there is a cartoon princess crown. The inside, which is what Dudley is really aiming for, includes the information that Dudley's been searching so desperately for.
Harry's latest phone number.
It takes him no less than seven tries, at random hours throughout the day, before Harry picks up the phone.
"Harry Potter speaking," his cousin's voice comes through. "And I swear to God, if this number has gotten out to the media already—"
"It's Dudley," Dudley cut in, his cousin's last sentence barely registering on his radar. Harry is somehow famous in the magical world, that much he knows, but he doesn't know the details.
"Dudley!" Harry sounds surprised, and then pleased. "How are you doing? How is new fatherhood treating you? Is she sleeping through the night yet? James didn't sleep through a night almost until he was eight months old, but Al slept like a rock."
"No, I—I mean, I'm fine, but I need to talk to you," Dudley replies, his words all coming out in a rush. He sounds panicked, and he hates sounding so panicked, but he doesn't know what else to do. "I need help."
"Okay…" Harry says, his cousin's tone showing his confusion. "What's up, Dud?"
"How did—how did you know you had magic?"
There's a long pause on the other end of the phone. "Er—I'm not sure I understand what you mean, Dud."
"It's Sophie," Dudley babbles, thankful that he's calling Harry from the office near the end of the day, thankful that his office door is closed, thankful that he invested in good soundproofing. "I think—I think she's magic."
